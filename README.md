# Ecto Flo

## About the name

"Ecto Flo" is an anagram generated from the phrase "From knowledge to action," but it doesn't have a specific meaning. Itâ€™s a random rearrangement of the letters in the original phrase without semantic significance.

## What?

Ecto Flo is a concept for managing, documenting, learning and developing code. It aims to be a second (developer) brain,
helping you to create and organize your projects, take notes and collect code related content, write and publish articles, search your code base, use AI to
query and re-use your own code in new scenarios. 

## How?

The first iteration of Ecto Flo is a django server running on docker. It can handle creation of new projects or clone existing, making the code searchable and re-usable in the process.
It gives you full overview of your projects, showing you which project has uncommited changes, what can be pushed or updated from origin. 

You can define templates for creating new projects or adding content to existing ones, using one or more cookiecutter templates with a web-based UI to provide arguments to the process.

It includes tools to integrate into your browser making it easy to save articles and youtube videos 
for later, and process, organize and archive AI chat sessions. An extension for Visual Studio Code makes your code base available while you work
and AI can help you make existing code fit into your current project.
